# Mentor Roadmap

As Mentor continues to evolve, we have outlined a roadmap to guide its development and ensure it meets the needs of its users. Below are the key features and enhancements planned for future releases:

## 1. Debugging Enhancements

- **Verbose Logging**: Implement detailed logging to trace the flow of data and operations within Mentor, aiding in development and troubleshooting.

- **Error Reporting**: Develop comprehensive error messages that provide clear guidance on issues and potential resolutions.

## 2. Request and Response Streaming

- **Streaming Support**: Enable support for request and response streaming in LLM adapters that offer this capability, allowing for more efficient data processing and real-time interactions.

## 3. Additional LLM Adapters

- **Anthropic Adapter**: Develop an adapter to integrate with Anthropic's language models, expanding the range of LLMs compatible with Mentor.

- **Ollama Adapter**: Create an adapter for Ollama's language models, providing users with more options for LLM integration.

- **Gemini Adapter**: Implement support for Gemini's language models, further diversifying Mentor's LLM compatibility.

## 4. Expanded Schema Support

- **Peri Schemas**: Integrate support for [Peri](https://hexdocs.pm/peri/readme.html) schemas, allowing users to define and validate data structures using Peri's flexible schema definitions.

- **Raw Maps and Structs**: Enhance Mentor to handle raw maps and structs natively, providing greater flexibility in defining and processing data structures.

## 5. Documentation and Examples

- **Comprehensive Guides**: Develop detailed documentation covering all features, configurations, and use cases of Mentor.

- **Code Examples**: Provide practical examples and tutorials to help users understand how to implement and utilize Mentor effectively.

## 6. Community Feedback and Contributions

- **User Feedback**: Actively seek input from the community to identify pain points, desired features, and areas for improvement.

- **Open Source Contributions**: Encourage contributions from developers to foster a collaborative and innovative development environment.

We are committed to delivering these enhancements to make Mentor a robust and versatile tool for developers working with various schemas and language models. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we progress on this journey.
